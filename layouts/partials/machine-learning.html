                NumPy forms the basis of powerful machine learning libraries
                like
                <a href="https://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a> and
                <a href="https://www.scipy.org">SciPy</a>.
                As machine learning grows, so does the
                list of libraries built on NumPy.
                <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org">TensorFlowâ€™s</a>
                deep learning capabilities have broad
                applications &mdash; among them speech and image recognition, text-based
                applications, time-series analysis, and video detection.
                <a href="https://pytorch.org">PyTorch</a>, another deep
                learning library, is popular among researchers in
                computer vision and natural language processing.
                <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet">MXNet</a>
                is another AI package, providing blueprints and
                templates for deep learning.
